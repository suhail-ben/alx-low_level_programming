The project "0x00. C - Hello, World" aims to facilitate the learning of C programming language, which is widely used in system programming, embedded systems, and high-performance computing. It offers a structured approach to learning C through several components such as tutorials, practice problems, projects, and resources. The tutorials include step-by-step guidance, code examples, and exercises to reinforce learning. The practice problems cover a range of topics, and the projects vary in complexity and cover game development, system programming, and web development. Resources such as books, online courses, and blogs are also provided to deepen the learners' understanding of C programming. The project is suitable for beginners and individuals with experience in other programming languages. The goals of this project are to provide a structured approach to learning C, help learners develop a solid foundation, apply their knowledge to real-world problems, and provide resources to deepen their understanding. Despite the challenges of learning C, this project aims to provide learners with the tools they need to develop their skills and achieve their goals.
